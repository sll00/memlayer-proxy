# Memlayer

> The plug-and-play memory layer for smart, contextual agents

Memlayer adds persistent, intelligent memory to any LLM, enabling agents that recall context across conversations, extract structured knowledge, and surface relevant information when it matters.

**<100ms Fast Search • Noise-Aware Memory Gate • Multi-Tier Retrieval Modes • 100% Local • Zero Config**

## Quick start

Install:

```bash
pip install memlayer
```

Basic usage:

```python
from memlayer.wrappers.openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini", storage_path="./memories", user_id="user_123")
client.chat([{"role": "user", "content": "My name is Alice and I work at TechCorp"}])
response = client.chat([{"role": "user", "content": "Where do I work?"}])
# -> "You work at TechCorp."
```

Memlayer automatically filters, extracts, stores and retrieves relevant memories, no manual prompts required.

## What makes Memlayer different

- **Selective long-term memory** — we only store what matters, not every chat line.  
- **Hybrid storage** — semantic vectors for recall plus a lightweight knowledge graph for relationships and updates.  
- **Noise-aware gate** — cheap salience checks (prototype embeddings + TF-IDF) keep the store clean.  
- **Multi-tier retrieval** — Fast / Balanced / Deep modes so you can trade latency for depth.  
- **Offline-first** — runs locally with no external services required.  
- **Zero config** — drop it into your app and start remembering.
