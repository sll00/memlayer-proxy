    Project Status Report - November 2025
    
    The Aurora Initiative is our flagship AI research project led by Dr. Sarah Chen.
    The project budget is $2.5 million, with completion expected by Q2 2026.
    
    Key milestones:
    - Phase 1 (Data Collection): Completed October 2025
    - Phase 2 (Model Training): In progress, 60% complete
    - Phase 3 (Deployment): Scheduled for March 2026
    
    The team consists of 8 researchers and 3 engineers. The project uses
    TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks, hosted on AWS infrastructure.
    
    Recent achievement: The model achieved 94% accuracy on validation tests,
    exceeding the initial target of 90%.
