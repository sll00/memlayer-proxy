# --- Graph Schema Definition ---
# We use raw Cypher queries for all operations, so we don't need to define
# OGM classes with GQLAlchemy's Node and Relationship base classes.
# This avoids the database connection requirement at import time.
# The schema is enforced through our Cypher queries using MERGE operations.
